        <br>Welcome to <em>Foodbazaar!</em> My name is Jenny, and I created <em>Foodbazaar</em> to celebrate how nourishing, fun, and delicious cooking with seasonal fruits and vegetables can be. I hope that the recipes here inspire you to try cooking a new vegetable, or try cooking a familiar vegetable in a new way.<br><br>
        I’m a food lover, number cruncher, and meticulous budgeter. I love science and art, and the way they come together when I cook. I love to create, problem solve, and learn new things. Making great food is my passion, my purpose, and my favorite thing to share with others.
